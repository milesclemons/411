# Story 1:
**As** a new user I **want** to be able to opt-out of using the calendar feature of this app. I am someone that likes to have all the entries in their calendar be manual and I don’t **want** an app to be able to change that. Also I have some very private information in my calendar that I don’t feel comfortable giving an app access to. I **want** to be able to log into the application and have the option to use it without the calendar feature. I also **want** to be able to make this decision at a later point, whether by linking my calendar to the app, changing my existing calendar that is linked (to another email address), or removing my calendar altogether.
