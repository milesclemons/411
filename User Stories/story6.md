## Story 6
**As** a login user, I **want** to create my own list of favorite restaurants/ the order that is often picked and also want to add/ remove any restaurants from my list at any time when I explore some new favorable restaurants and bored with eating a certain type of dishes **so that** I can update my list of favorite restaurants based on my recent preferences and eating habits. When I want to order my food, I **want** to pick a restaurant from my list directly **so that** I can pick a favorable restaurant when I donâ€™t know/care what I eat and save time spent on selecting restaurants and dishes.
