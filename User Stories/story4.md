**As** a user deciding between pickup or delivery, **I want** to be told upfront what the delivery fees will cost, how long the delivery will take, how far away the restaurant is away from me walking distance, and how many calories I would possibly burn walking to and from the restaurant if I pick up instead of delivery, **so that** I can make sure that I am making the best financial choice for pick-up or delivery, the most reasonable choice for restaurants located close by, and to be incentivised to walk to pick up to feel a bit better about the number of calories I will consume in the food order because I walked instead of sitting and waiting.
