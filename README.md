Hi Professor Donham. 

I hope you were able to see our email about the major problem our project ran into this Monday. 

Some of our backend code is in the DjangularPrototype folder. Some of the code that would be added to this was lost, but the general structure of what is in there
now is what our final project backend code would have looked like.

Our new user stories are located in docs. Our old prototype/proposals/user stories are in the main branch.

We added a folder called media. Within this folder is pictures Miles had happened to take of some of the code before we lost it. We hope this can at least show that we 
did have most of the frontend coded before we lost it. We also have a video of how our first API call working before we lost it. 

The 2 APIS we used were https://countryflagsapi.com/ and https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
The specific details of our application functionality can be found in user stories.

To summarize, our application was able to successfully call both API's and store the data in SQLite, and display the data in Angular. However, the third component,
OAuth, was pretty challenging for us. This was never fully working before we lost our code.
