Our group chose 2 technology stacks, including Angular and Django. In this document, we will explain why we chose these 2 stacks and how we used them to implement our project.

For the frontend, Angular provides modules and code structure, which makes it easier to use for JavaScript developers. We were only looking for our application to have a single page, and to just switch between different components on the displayed page. We had some experience with HTML and CSS before for page layouts and styling. We made a shared services typescript file to make API calls to our backend and as well as our third party API's. We were also able to find the most clear tutorials in Angular, which ultimatly was the reason why we picked this technology since we are beginners in Software Eng.

For the backend, we decided to use Django because of the following reasons. Firstly, the backend developers in our group are all proficient in Python, so our chosen backend stack should also be based on Python. In this case, Spring Boot and Node.js would not be our options, and Django, a python-based fullstack web framework, is easier for us to implement our project. Secondly, Django initializes the structures of a basic project and apps for the developers. It also contains different types of layers, including module, view, and template, that help the developers to develop the backend. Thirdly, it supports multiple databases from small to large scales, such as sqlite3 (what our project is based on), MySQL, and MariaDB. The simple connection to the database provided by Django makes it easier for us to quickly get access to the database and GET or POST our data.
