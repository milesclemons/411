# Story 2:
**As** a new user I **want** to create a new account for this app but I don’t have a Spotify subscription. I still **want** to be able to have the app provide me with the appropriate music depending on the type of meal I chose but I don’t **want** to have to subscribe to spotify since I cannot afford it. I **should** also be able to change my decision at a later point. I **want** to be able to say that I don’t have a spotify account now but, if down the road I get one, I **want** to be able to add an account later. If that happens I also **want** to have the ability to un-link my spotify account for privacy reasons.
